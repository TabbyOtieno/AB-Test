# AB-Test
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Modules used for this project are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Statsmodels.

The topics covered are: Data Cleaning, Probability, Hypothesis Testing, and Logistic Regression(predicting using one variable, multiple variables, and addition of an interaction).
